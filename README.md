# Practical-Application-3
Application to compare performance of Classifier Models and identify the feature importance that affects the customer acceptance of banking products over the telephone-based marketing.

## Business Objectives
The application is built based on the CRISP-DM framework. The following are the business objective of this application,
1. Identify the performance/accuracy score of Classifier Models
2. Identify the factors that affect the customer acceptance of banking products via telephone marketing
3. Summarize and provide future recommendations

## Data
The dataset comes from the UCI Machine Learning repository (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/bank+marketing). The data is from a Portugese banking institution and is a collection of the results of multiple marketing campaigns. The dataset contains 41188 entires with a total of 21 columns.
As noted in the data documentation, the 'duration' feature should only be included for benchmark purposes and should be discarded if the intention is to have a realistic predictive model. Hence, this feature is dropped for our model analysis.

## Classification Models Used
The following Classifier Models were used in this application,
1. DummyClassifier() - for baseline prediction
2. LogisticRegression()
3. KNeighborClassifier()
4. DecisionTreeClassifier()
5. RandomForestClassifier()
6. SVC()

In the initial analysis, **KNeighborClassifier()** and **LogisticalRegression()** models outformed the other models.

After the initial analysis, the *GridSearchCV()* is applied to identify the best hyperparamaters and improved the performance of these Classifier Models. Among the improved models, **KNeighborClassifier()** and **DecisionTreeClassifier()** model outperformed the other improved classifier models.

### Feature Importance of top models
Based on all the model analysis, the following features exhibited the highest feature importance,
1. euribor3m
2. nr.employed

## Conclusion
* In this application, we were able to identify that **KNeighborClassifier()** and **LogisticalRegression()** models outperformed the other models for the given dataset
* When improving the models with best hyperparameteres *GridSearchCV()*, **KNeighborClassifier()** and **DecisionTreeClassifier()** models outperformed the other models for the given dataset
* Both euribor3m and nr.employed features exhibited high feature importance
* By focusing on these features, will emable the marketing team for better acceptance of bank products to its customers.
